# College-s-Residential-Options
1. Objective of Project: 
To find out the frequency of students commenting on the 
subreddit: r/nus on Reddit on the different Residential Options 
that are available in campus from 1 May â€“ 1 June 2021.

2. Target Audience:
Incoming freshmen and Seniors whom are interested in applying 
for campus residences in AY21/22.

3. Background:
Due to COVID-19, it has been difficult for incoming freshman or 
current undergraduates to find out about the popularity of the 
different residential options among students as there are limited 
social interactions to find out a rough estimate for it. Even though 
polls can be easily conducted, the sample size may be small and 
several students might not be truthful while reporting the 
numbers.

4. Goals and Benefits:
Students will be better informed of the popularity of the various 
residential options and may consider alternative options (Less 
popular Residential Options, Off-campus residences etc.) in the 
case of their unsuccessful application due to high demand, based 
on the findings.
